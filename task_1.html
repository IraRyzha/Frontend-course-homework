        <section id="introduction">
            <p>What started as a strong teen drama with thrilling mysteries and good twists and hit season two with a good plot, by season three totally lost it's charm, it no longer has any logic or reason begind it, simply a bunch of teens walking around acting like they're adults and adults letting a bunch of kids run the town in the most ridiculous ways to the point it's no longer in connection with reality</p>

            <p>The characters transform inexplicably from week to week, and everything is so absurd, that 99% of it is impossible to comprehend. Yet there is something rather addictive about it, sure it's full of beautiful people, but there are some really interesting characters too, Cheryl in particular, great fun. They have recycled scenes from Carrie, Halloween, and just about every movie you can think of, but who cares, this is low brow, trashy, hugely enjoyable escapism. I would never repeat watch it, but I'll always sit down to a new series. 7/10</p>

                The series is based on the performance of amazing, bright actors. Each of them is a wonderful personality capable of attracting attention. Lucifer was played by Tom Ellis. The result was an eccentric middle-aged man. The terrible look is complemented by red shades and lack of skin. In the second season there is an amazing twist when the devil himself is interested in justice and tries to achieve it. As a result, it will be possible to even see his cut off wings, at least for a short time. It is the earth that becomes the real home for this supernatural creature.
                Decker is played by Lauren German. The detective is immune to Lucifer's abilities, but begins to warm up to him as a human being. Romantic relationships gradually begin, but they are hampered by the line of fate and contradicted by unearthly circumstances.
                Excellent supporting characters include the detective's ex-husband and Lucifer's brother. They are trying to return the heroes to their familiar environment. So that the woman forgets about romantic thoughts, and the demon king goes to solve problems in hell. However, love, the thirst for justice and real earthly life strongly draw in the heroes, drawing them closer and closer to each other.
                At the moment, Lucifer has ceased to exist, and each of the seasons knows how to keep the viewer in suspense from the beginning to the end of all episodes, fueling them with various emotions.</p>

            <p>The events in the eighth episode of the fourth season of “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” unfold around a lovely fifteen-year-old girl who is both half-witch and half-mortal. The girl lives on a fine line between two worlds - on the one hand, an ordinary modern teenager, and on the other hand, the heiress to the title of Queen of Hell. So far she has managed to balance between the two worlds, creating a “temporal paradox.” But she won’t be able to hold out like this for long; it could upset the power balance between hell and the human world. Sabrina's sixteenth birthday is approaching.</p>
